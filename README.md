# 02402-Statistics-Polytechnical-Foundation

## Course contents
Simple methods for graphical and tabular assessments of collected or measured data: empirical distributions, histogram, normal probability plot, box plot. Model formulation. Model control: control of distribution function. Application of especially Poisson-, binomial-, exponential- and normal distribution. Estimation and test of parameters and construction of confidence intervals in frequently occuring situations (e.g. means, variances, proportions). Regression analysis with one independent variable and introduction to the analysis of variance and to the analysis of contingency tables, estimation theory and simulation based methods.

The course will use a programming language as the main language but also show similarities and differences with other functional languages.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Estimate and interpret simple summary statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, variance, median and quartiles as well as correlation.
* Apply simple graphical techniques, including histograms, qq-normal plots, and box plots.
* Identify and describe probability distributions, including Poisson, binomial, exponential and the normal distribution using the computer program R.
* Compare different statistical methods.
* Apply and interpret important statistical concepts, such as the formulation of models, parameter estimation, construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
* Apply and interpret simulation based statistical methods.
* Apply and interpret simple statistical methods within one- and two sample situations and for count data.
* Apply and interpret simple statistical methods within simple and multiple linear regression and one- and two-way analysis of variance.
* Use the program R and interpret its output.
* Interpret power considerations and perform sample size calculations in different settings using the program R.
* Debate and criticize empirical based information.
* Recognize core statistical terms.
